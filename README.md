Design Problem:
In a specific high school, students have to swipe their IDs when they come to class in order to take attendance. The ID numbers are converted to names and then stored. If a student swipes more than once in a day, the system only stores their name once. At the end of the day, the teachers check the results to see who came to class and who didnâ€™t. Design a system to keep track of attendance. Note that the machine that helps people swipe to take attendance takes ID numbers as its input.

I created two classes for this project (+1 for testing). 

I have designed the system to input the ID numbers as string but I would have liked to ask more clarification questions about this, such as if the id numbers have any special symbols, specific format or integer type.

Do students with the same name have different ID numbers ? 

Would there be need to store any more information about the student in addition to their name and ID number ? (I added a student class after discussing this as a possiblity with the Professer so that more data about the student can be recorded if needed).

Should there be a manual way to record attendance for the students if they forgot their ID card.
